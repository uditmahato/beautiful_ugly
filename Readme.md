# Beauty Classification Game

## Introduction
This is a simple web-based game that allows users to either upload an image or capture one using their device's camera. The captured or uploaded image is then classified by the system as either "beautiful" or "ugly" (for entertainment purposes only).

## Instructions
1. **Upload Image**: Click on the "Choose File" button to upload an image from your device.
2. **Capture Image**: If your device supports it, click on the "Capture" button to take a picture using your device's camera.
3. **Classify Image**: After uploading or capturing an image, click on the "Classify" button to see the system's classification.

## Browser Compatibility
The game requires access to the device's camera. Make sure your browser supports the `getUserMedia` API for camera access. If your browser does not support camera access, you'll receive an alert message informing you of this limitation.

## How It Works
- **Image Selection**: The game allows users to select an image file from their device or capture one using the device's camera.
- **Image Processing**: The selected/captured image is displayed on the screen for review.
- **Image Classification**: The system randomly classifies the image as either "beautiful" or "ugly" (for entertainment purposes only).
- **Result Display**: The classification result is displayed to the user.

## Note
- The image classification is purely random and for entertainment purposes only.
- This game does not store any images or personal data.
